# Code contributions

Contributions for this code are more than welcome if and only if:

* What is added/altered and why
* If there are no unneeded dependencies added
* It doesn't break the code
* It keeps the code suitable as template code for usage in other projects
* It is accompanied with a clear README.md, or appended to the main README.md
* Its written in >= python3.x
* The code itself is internally documented to with clear comments
* No magic paramaters like 'x = 42'
* It still runs in docker environment

I am happy with any addition if above rules are met.

Kind Regards,
